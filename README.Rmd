# Single Cell Pathway Analysis

![](man/figures/scpa_outline.png)

### About SCPA
SCPA is a method for pathway analysis in single cell RNA-seq data. It's a novel approach to pathway analysis that defines pathway activity as a change in multivariate distribution of a given pathway across conditions, rather than enrichment or over representation of genes. This approach allows for a number of benefits over current methods, including:

1. You will identify pathways that show enrichment in a given population AND also identify pathways with no overall enrichment but alterations in the multivariate distribution of that pathway. You essentially get the best of both worlds, as pathways with changes in multivariate distribution but no overall enrichment are still interestingly different pathways.

1. SCPA allows for multisample testing, so you can compare multiple conditions simultaneously e.g. compare across 3 time points, or across multiple phases of a [pseuodotime trajectory](https://jackbibby1.github.io/SCPA/articles/pseudotime.html). This means you can assess pathway activity through multiple stimulation phases, or across cell differentiation

To see the stats behind SCPA, you can see our paper in JASA [here](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/01621459.2020.1791131)

We are currently putting a paper together to show the power of SCPA applied in a systematic way over
a T cell scRNAseq dataset, which will be available on bioRxiv soon.
