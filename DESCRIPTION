Description: SCPA performs pathway analysis on single cell data. 
    It relies on understanding changes in multivariate distributions 
    of pathways between samples as a basis for judging biological 
    relevance. Two basic arguments are necessary: matrices of data
    and pathways that you want to analyze. See the GitHub page:
    https://github.com/jackbibby1/SCPA for a detailed description and tutorials.
